Copy the files into a directory and remember that folder.  In that folder rename
the streamdeck.properties.default file to streamdeck.properties and edit the file
using Notepad or another text editor.

In StreamDeck, add a new System > Open button.  In App / File use the three-dots
button to locate the executable. You will add the following command line options,
using an example of extracting the files into C:\PBS

C:\PBS\PBStreamDeck.exe C:\PBS key_from_file

For example, using the runmods example from the default properties file:

C:\PBS\PBStreamDeck.exe C:\PBS runmods

The file pblogo.png is included to use in Stream Deck as a replacement image for the
default one provided for the button.
