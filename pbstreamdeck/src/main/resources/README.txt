To setup the application, open the following in the Start Menu and follow the
notes within the file:

	Start > PBStreamDeck > Edit Properties File.

In StreamDeck, add a new System > Open button.  In App / File use the three-dots
button to point to the executable in the folder you installed it into during
the setup process.  By default this will be:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\PBStreamDeck\PBStreamDeck.exe

In StreamDeck put a parameter to the executable that indicates the command/chat
key that you want to execute.  Using the runmods example:

	C:\Program Files (x86)\PBStreamDeck\PBStreamDeck.exe runmods
	
The file pblogo.png is included to use in Stream Deck as a replacement image
for the default one provided for the button.  This is located in the
folder with the executable.
